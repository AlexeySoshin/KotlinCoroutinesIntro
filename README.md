# Introduction to Coroutines in Kotlin

This repository contains list of examples of problems for using threads, and how Kotlin attempts to solve them using coroutines. <br />
Each example is executable.


## Installation
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Experimental status
Since coroutines are experimental in Kotlin 1.1, everything that's related to them will be highlighted<br />
You can remove the highlighting by enabling `coroutines 'enable'` in `build.gradle`
